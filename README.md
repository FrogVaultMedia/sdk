# 🐸 Frogvault Studio

**Building the future on Solana.**

Frogvault Studio is a product-focused studio designing, building, and shipping next-generation applications on Solana.  
We move fast, experiment boldly, and turn ideas into live systems—not slides.

## 🚀 What We Do

At Frogvault Studio, we focus on:
- ⚡ **Solana-native products**
- 🧠 **AI & automation tooling**
- 🪙 **DeFi, infra, and on-chain experiments**
- 🌐 **Web3 consumer apps**
- 🧪 Rapid prototyping → real deployments

We believe execution beats intention. Every project here is built to run, scale, and evolve.

---

## 🧩 Philosophy

- **Ship first, refine later**
- **Code over hype**
- **On-chain by default**
- **Open experimentation**
- **Fast feedback loops**

We treat Solana as a playground for serious builders.

## 🌱 Open Source

We believe in building in public.
Some tools are shared early, some stay internal—everything is built with real usage in mind.

Contributions, ideas, and forks are welcome.

---

## 🧭 Road Ahead

- More Solana-native primitives  
- AI-powered workflows  
- Faster experimentation cycles  
- Shipping > talking  

If it runs on Solana, Frogvault Studio is interested.
